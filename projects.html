        <p>
            Discordrb is a gem for accessing the Discord API. I've been involved with the development since 2018 and now act as the
            project lead and primary developer.
            <br /><br />
            I've made quite a few contributions; adding missing features, implementing <i>new</i> features, optimizations, and refactoring existing code.
            My largest accomplishments with the project so far are <a href="https://github.com/shardlab/discordrb/commit/0f74a1e10def06fa82c34a9d517174a496f00657">improving the websocket
            efficiency by 300%</a>, <a href="https://github.com/shardlab/discordrb/commit/4b1c9f0c095476e9e75bfd19e0153b44c6f86d73">updating the voice sending functionality</a>, and
            <a href="https://github.com/shardlab/discordrb/commit/0c814527ab582e6bea31eb17a30f697f42b12149">updating to support multiple user activities</a>.
            <br /><br />
            Working as the maintainer has given me valuable experience in leading an OSS community, working with git, and futhering my knowledge of RESTful APIs. It has also given me a very
            valuable opportunity to socialize with Discord employees and get insight to the design process of a large company.

            This was made to enable the use of erlang's ETF format inside of Ruby via a native extension written in C++. It makes use of Discord's erlpack, as well as
            custom serde methods, to interact with Discord's gateway. It was originally made for my own API wrapper, vox, but will also work for anyone that wishes to use
            it to create their own custom gateway solution.

            This is the documentation bot for the discordrb channel on the unofficial Discord API server. It's features are as follows:
            <ul style="padding-left: 10px; list-style: inside;">
                <li>Search and format YARD documentation</li>
                <li>Evaluate Ruby, Crystal, and C via a sandboxed eval service</li>
                <li>Reference github issues/pull requests from the discordrb repository</li>
                <li>Show the source of a given method</li>
            </ul>
            <br /><br />
            I'm especially proud of this bot, mostly because of how the YARD => Discord formatting works. I wrote custom ERB templates for
            the YARD generator to use, so it outputs a message formatted specifically for Discord using markdown and ASCII art. The end result is somewhat buggy
            as I encounter new issues where certain tags don't fit what my template expects, but I enjoy it none the less.

        <p>
            This was originally a fork of <a href="https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm">Hackplayers/evil-winrm</a> because their code was frankly offensively bad.
            However, I soon realized that it would take much less effort to completely remake their tool from the ground up with a more modular and configurable approach.
            Things like a configurable and remote rendered prompt, various log modes, tab completion of plugin commands as well as remote directory completion, and enhanced color support
            are just a small number of reasons why eventually our entire penetration testing team was using eviler-winrm over the more popular tool fairly quickly.

            Music bots are a large and important part of the Discord bot community. One of the most popular tools used by these music bots is Lavalink, allowing the voice connection
            logic to be outside of their application and allow for playing of different media sources such as soundcloud or youtube. This library interfaces with a lavalink server in a generic
            way that allows discordrb or vox to play music entirely externally for the first time since discordrb's inception.

            This is a little tool written in Rust that allows a user to quickly download a LICENSE file via its SPDX identifier (e.g: MIT, 0BSD, MPL-1.0, etc).
            I made it so I would have a reason to use Rust and so I could be lazy about downloading licenses for new projects.
